## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Used

- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`

## üìå Sample Query (Top 5 Individual Food Types)

```sql
SELECT 
  LOWER(TRIM(food)) AS Food_Type,
  COUNT(*) AS Frequency,
  ROUND(AVG(Price), 0) AS Avg_Price,
  ROUND(AVG(Total_ratings), 0) AS Avg_Total_Ratings
FROM (
  SELECT TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Food_type, ',', 1)) AS food, Price, Total_ratings FROM swiggy
  UNION ALL
  SELECT TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Food_type, ',', 2), ',', -1)), Price, Total_ratings FROM swiggy
  UNION ALL
  SELECT TRIM(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(Food_type, ',', 3), ',', -1)), Price, Total_ratings FROM swiggy
) AS exploded
GROUP BY LOWER(TRIM(food))
ORDER BY Avg_Total_Ratings DESC, Frequency DESC
LIMIT 5;
